Model Summary
-------------

Models Tried:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor

Evaluation Metrics:
- RMSE and R² were used to evaluate performance.
- Random Forest showed the best performance with the lowest RMSE and highest R² score.

Assumptions & Notes:
- Missing values were checked and handled,Reductant columns were removed.
- Categorical features were encoded using OneHotEncoder.
- Used a RandomForest with simplified parameters.
- Hyperparameter tuning was done using GridSearchCV, but was not implemented in the notebook because of time constraint and code is commented out.

Final Model:
- Random Forest Regressor with nearly best parameters.
- n_estimators=100,
- max_depth=20,
- min_samples_leaf=1
- RMSE : 5.355097450479262
- R2 score : 0.9999748318494079
